This repository contains all of the hardware and software modifications
we have made to our two Ultimaker 2 printers.

Included here is a fork of the Ultimaker 2 marlin firmware with the
necessary tweaks needed to complement the hardware tweaks.

See 'Ultimaker 2 Experiences and Modifications.pdf' for a detailed
outline of all the the modifications. The CAD files for the described
hardware mods are in this repository along with pictures of the
installation. 

See Strawson's 'Ultimaker Settings.fff' for the SImplify3D settings we
use with this configuration.
